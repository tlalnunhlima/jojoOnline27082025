<em><p>5) INPUT-OUTPUT DEVICES - (4 MARKS)</p></em>

<p><b>Input and output (I/O) devices</b> allow the computer system to interact with the outside world by
moving data into and out of the system. They are also known as peripheral devices because they
surround a computer’s CPU and memory.</p>

<p><b>An input device </b>is used to bring data into the system. Some input devices are - Keyboard, Mouse,
Microphone, Bar code reader, Graphics tablet.  <b>A computer keyboard</b> is a typewriter-style device which is composed of buttons that
create letters, numbers, and symbols, as well as perform other functions. The most popular keyboard
used today is the 101-keys QWERTY keyboard. <b>Point & Draw Devices</b> is a hardware input device that allows the user to move the mouse pointer.
Good examples of pointing devices are a computer mouse, trackball, light pens and touch screen.
Mouse is the most popular point and draw device. <b>Data scanning device </b> is an electronic device that scans printed or handwritten text documents,
images, or certain objects, and converts them into a digital file format. Eg., flatbed scanners and
handheld scanners. <b>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) device </b> scanner first creates the bitmap image of the
document and then the OCR software translates the array of grid points into ASCII text that the
computer can interpret as letters, numbers, and special characters. <b>Optical Mark Reader (OMR)</b> is a scanner, which can recognize a pre-specified type of mark made by
pencil or pen. For example, in objective type tests, the answer sheets are fed to an OMR device for
grading with a computer automatically. <b>Bar-code reader</b> is a device for reading (de-coding) bar-coded data. Data coded in the form of small
lines are known as bar codes. All types of goods, books, postal packages, badges, tags, etc. use bar
codes for unique identification purpose. <b>
Magnetic-Ink Character Recognition (MICR)</b>  is similar to OCR. Banking industry uses it for faster
cheque processing.  <b> A digitizer </b> is an input device used for converting (digitizing) pictures, maps, and drawings into
digital form for input to computers. Architects and engineers commonly use digitizers in the area of
Computer Aided Design (CAD) for designing cars, building, medical devices, robots, mechanical parts,
etc. <b> Electronic card readers </b> are electronic devices that can read plastic cards embedded with either a
barcode, magnetic strip, computer chip or another storage medium. Eg. ATM (automatic teller
machines) is also debit/credit card reader device. <b> Speech recognition devices </b> are input devices that allow a person to input data to a computer
system by speaking to it. </p>

<p> <b>AN OUTPUT DEVICE </b> - Output
devices generate computer outputs
that are broadly of following two types
- Soft-copy output and hard-copy
output.

<p>
<b>Some output devices are </b> - <b>Monitors</b> are the most popular softcopy output devices used today. A
monitor is associated usually with a
keyboard and together they form a
video display terminal (VDT). A VDT
(often referred to as just terminal) is both an input and output device. Two basic types of monitors are
cathode-ray-tube (CRT) and LCD (Liquid Crystal display) flat-panel.

<b>Printers </b> are the most popular hard-copy output devices used today. Different types of printers are
described below.
<b>Dot-Matrix Printers </b> are character
printers that print one character at a
time. Dot-matrix printers are impact
printers because they print by
hammering pins on an inked ribbon
to leave ink impressions on a paper.
The printing speeds 30 to 600
characters per second.
<b>Inkjet Printers</b> are character
printers that form characters and
images by spraying small drops of ink
on a paper. The print head can
contains upto 64 tiny nozzles. It has printing speeds ranging 40 to 300 characters per second. Inkjet
printers are non impact printer and are both monochrome and color.
<b>Drum printers</b> are line printers that print an entire line at a time. Recall that dot matrix and inkjet
printers print one character at a time. Due to impact printing, drum printers are noisy in operation and
printing speeds are in the range of 300 to 2000 lines per minute.
<b>Chain/Band Printers </b> are line
printers that print one line at a time.
The chain/band rotates at a high
speed. Unlike the drum of a drum
printer, we can change the chain of
the chain printer easily. Chain
printers are impact printers.
<b>Laser Printers </b> are page printers
that print one page at a time. Main components of a laser printner are a laser beam source, a multi-sided mirror, a photoconductive drum, and
toner. The most common laser printers have resolution of 600 dpi (dots per inch) to 1200 dpi. Laser printers are
non impact printers.
<b>Plotters </b> - A plotter is an ideal output device for architects, engineers, city planners, and others who
need to generate high precision, hard-copy, graphic output of varying sizes. Two types of plotters in
common use are drum plotter and flatbed plotter.

<b>Screen Image Projector </b> - is an output device, which is used to display information from a computer
on a large screen so that a group of people can view it simultaneously. It has become common
presentation equipment today.

<b>Voice Response Systems </b> enables a computer to talk to a user. It has an audio-response device that
produces audio output. Voice response systems are of two types – voice reproduction system and
speech synthesizer.
<b>Voice reproduction system </b> produces audio output by selecting an audio output from a set of prerecorded audio responses. Eg., ATM machine audio help for guiding how to operate ATM system.
<b>Speech Synthesizer </b> converts text information into spoken sentences. To produce speech, it
combines basic sound units called phonemes. This is very useful for reading out text information to blind
persons.
